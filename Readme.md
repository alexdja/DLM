# Program for affinne automata limit plot drawing
 
- Add button - adds a new affinne function to list 
- Draw button - draws a affinne automata limit plot
- Precision - number of points on the 3d plot (can't be < 10)
- [x] show general plot - show plots of all functions in one picture
- [x] show separately - show all plots separately each in it's own matplotlib window
 
> [!Warning]
> Plot of the function will be drawn only if the coefficients are rational a p-adic integers.

If one of the coefficients isn't been entered it's assuming to be 0.
